# WordAssociationGame

The game consists of trying to solve the final word using the words that are already opened or solved. Each player can open one field on their turn and guess the column or final word, or end their turn without guessing. At the start of the game the players must be picked: either from the combo box if they already played before, or added as a new player with a unique name. The game starts by clicking the green button. At the end of the game all the players are shown in a table with some of their statistics.
